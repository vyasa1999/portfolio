  aboutMe: `I am a 24 year old Indian-American who's lived all around the world. My dad worked for the U.S. State Department so as a result I've lived in Manila, Philippines, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Tokyo, Japan. Everywhere I go I bring a piece of those cultures with me and I love to share my experiences with others. I currently live in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, and take full advantage of my accessibility to water sports. I am currently working as a Full Stack Developer at Positive Behavior Supports Corp. I am passionate about learning new technologies and building meaningful solutions to real-world problems. I am a quick learner and I am always looking for new opportunities to grow and develop my skills.`,
